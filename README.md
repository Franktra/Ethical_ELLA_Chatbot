# 🤖 Ethical-ELLA-Chatbot

✨ This project aims to develop an Ethical AI Chatbot called Ethical-Ella. The chatbot utilizes a combination of natural language processing and machine learning techniques to provide meaningful and unbiased responses to user queries. It incorporates features such as bias detection and mitigation, content filtering, and response evaluation to ensure the ethical behavior of the chatbot. 🌐🔬🤝

## Project Overview

The project consists of the following components:

### Action Framework 🏗️
Defines a framework for generating, evaluating, and refining responses based on user prompts and feedback. It includes methods for generating responses, evaluating response quality, and refining responses based on user feedback.

### Chatbot Model 🤖🧠
Implements a chatbot model using TensorFlow and Keras. The model architecture includes an encoder-decoder structure with LSTM layers for sequence processing. The model is trained on a dataset, and the training process involves tokenization, vocabulary creation, and batch training.

### Bias Detection and Mitigation 🚫🧪
Utilizes Huggingface's transformers library to detect and mitigate potential bias in the chatbot responses. It performs sentiment analysis on the responses and warns if biased content is detected.

### Content Filtering 🚧🔒
Implements a content filtering mechanism to identify and filter out harmful or inappropriate content in the chatbot responses. The logic for content filtering can be customized as per requirements.

### Response Generation 🗣️💡
Generates responses using the trained chatbot model and incorporates bias detection and content filtering mechanisms to provide ethical and safe responses to user queries.

## Usage 📚🚀

To use the Ethical-Ella chatbot do listed instructctions in `bot.py`:

1. Load and preprocess the data: Implement the `load_and_preprocess_data` function to load and preprocess the dataset for training the chatbot model.

2. Define the chatbot model: Use the `create_chatbot_model` function to define the architecture of the chatbot model. Adjust the parameters such as input/output vocabulary size, embedding dimension, and LSTM units as per your requirements.

3. Train the model: Implement the data batching and training process using the `model.fit` function. Adjust the batch size, number of epochs, and other training parameters as needed.

4. Save the model: After training, save the chatbot model using the `model.save` function.

5. Generate responses: Use the `generate_response` function to generate responses from the chatbot model. Provide a user query as input, and the function will return an appropriate response. The response is checked for bias and filtered for harmful content before being returned.

6. Evaluate and refine responses: The `ActionFramework` class provides methods for evaluating and refining responses based on user feedback. It currently uses cosine similarity for evaluation and includes a placeholder for response refinement logic.

7. Customization: Customize the prompts, action words, and user feedback in the main function to simulate different scenarios. Modify the content filtering and bias detection mechanisms as required.
